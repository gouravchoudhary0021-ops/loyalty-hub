You do **not** need a credit card or a paid subscription to launch this app. Use one of these three professional free methods.

### 1. Vercel (Recommended - Best for AI)
Vercel is the most popular platform for React apps. It is **Free Forever** for personal use.

1. Create a free account at [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com).
2. Connect your GitHub account.
3. Import your project folder.
4. **Important:** Add your `API_KEY` in the "Environment Variables" section so the AI works.
5. Click **Deploy**. Done!

### 2. Netlify (Easiest - Drag & Drop)
If you don't want to use GitHub, use Netlify's "Drop" feature.

1. Go to [app.netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop).
2. Drag your project folder onto the page.
3. Once live, go to **Site Settings > Environment Variables** and add your `API_KEY`.
4. Your site is now live at a `netlify.app` address for free.

### 3. GitHub Pages (The Most Permanent)
Great for hosting simple static sites forever.

1. Upload your code to a new repository on [GitHub](https://github.com).
2. Go to **Settings > Pages**.
3. Select "Deploy from a branch" and choose `main`.
4. *Note:* For this specific React app, Vercel (Method 1) is usually easier because it handles the "Building" process automatically.

### 💡 Pro Tip
When you are on your live website, open it on your **Mobile Phone**. Scan the QR codes from the Merchant Dashboard using your phone's camera to experience exactly what a real customer would see!
